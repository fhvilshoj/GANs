    "We need to define some measure of distance between these two distributions. Since we usually define $p_g$ by transforming some sorce of randomnes $p_z$ by using $G$, it might be meaningful to define our measure as \"how much we need to change $p_g$ to obtain $p_d$\". Intuitively, you can think of $p_g$ and $p_d$ above as piles of earth. One possible distance measure between these two \"piles of earth\" is then how much work we need to perform to turn the first pile of earth into the other pile. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\gamma(x,y)$ denote a plan for how we want to move the earth. For example, $\\gamma(1,4)=3$ means we move $3$ units of earth from $p_g$ at $x=1$ to $x=4$. If we also let $\\gamma(2,3)=1$ our plan would have succesfully transformed $p_d$ into $p_g$. \n",
    "\n",
